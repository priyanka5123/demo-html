        internet</a> connects computers around the world so we can share and access information quickly. 
        Below are some key concepts that explain how it all works:</p>

   <h2>Core Internet Concepts</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>What is an IP Address?</strong></br> An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique set of numbers assigned to each device connected to the internet. It acts like a home address that helps devices find and communicate with each other. 
    </br>Example:"Websites need IP addresses to work because they tell your computer exactly where to send and receive data — just like a GPS location."</li>
    <li><strong>What is DNS(Domain Name System)?</strong></br> The Domain Name System (DNS) works like the internet’s phone book. 
        It translates domain names (like <a href="https://www.google.com/" >www.google.com</a>) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.36), so browsers can load websites.
    </br>Example:"DNS lets you visit www.google.com instead of having to type a long string of numbers — it’s easier to remember names than IP addresses."</li>
    <li><strong>What is a Domain Name?</strong></br> A domain name is the easy-to-remember name of a website, like <a href="https://openai.com/">openai.com</a>
         It represents the IP address of the web server behind the scenes.
        </br>Example:"People buy domain names for websites instead of using IP addresses because domain names are easier for humans to read, share, and remember."</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Browsers and HTML</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>What is a Web Browser?</strong></br> A web browser is a software application (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) that lets you access and interact with websites on the internet.
    </br>Example:"A browser helps users view websites, fill out forms, watch videos, and click links — it turns code into things you can see and use."</li>
    <li><strong>What is HTML?</strong></br>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, and more.
    </br>Example:"HTML is considered the backbone of web pages because it provides the basic building blocks for content and layout."</li>
    <li><strong>What happens when you enter a URL into a Browser?</strong></br>
        <ol>
            <li>You type a URL (like <a href="https://www.google.com/" >www.google.com</a>) into the browser.</li>
            <li>The browser sends a request to a DNS server to get the IP address.</li>
            <li>It then requests the website's files from the web server at that IP address.</li>
            <li>The server sends back HTML, CSS, and images.</li>
            <li>The browser reads the HTML and displays the web page on your screen.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Questions After Experimenting</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>What happens if you forget to close a tag like h1?</strong></br>The browser may render the entire page as a heading because it doesn't know where the heading ends.</li>
    <li><strong>What is the purpose of the a tag’s href attribute?</strong></br>The href attribute tells the browser where the link should go when clicked.</li>
    <li><strong>How does saving your file as .html affect how your browser opens it?</strong></br>It tells the browser to treat the file as a web page and render the HTML code properly.</li>
   </ul>
